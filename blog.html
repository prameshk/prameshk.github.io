						<div class=textHeader>On interest</div>
						<p>Upon further reflection, I've decided I want to write an interesting blog, and a blog worthy of being interesting.</p>
						<p>Humans like information. Specifically, they like to be in situations with the greatest amount of information inflow. For this reason, broadcasters of information (people, books, websites, television shows) and places with a high density of broadcasters (cities, colleges, the internet) are prized. The concept of “interesting” refers to these broadcasters and infodense places.</p>
						<p>Except interestingness refers to information-dense subjects only so far as the human instinct is correct. “Interesting” refers to anything that piques the human thirst for information, and like the referents of every other human action, it has been co-opted, pulverized, and rolled into virtual twinkies in places like Buzzfeed.</p>
						<p>So: a blog should be interesting so far as it serves what the instinct of interest is supposed to hunt out: an infodense source. </p>
						<p>Humans like to be constantly interested because a happy human is an infodense human, and for the same reason they like being interesting even better: it implies they've reached the goal for which the information instinct strives.</p>
						<p>For that selfish, not sharing impulse, I'd like to write an interesting blog.</p>

						<div class=textHeader>On links within the badthink blog</div>
						<p> When writing the first post, it struck me that I'd like to link to a few things. (I did). First, I decided I needed a few ground rules for myself. </p>
						<ol>
							<li>Don't link to reference pages. If the reader needs a definition, they can google it. I don't need to condescend.</li>
							<li>Link to people and small organizations. Unlike reference works, these may not be easy to find. Plus, because people like to be interesting, they might appreciate it.</li>
							<li>Link to the specific, not the general. For the same reasons as above.</li>
							<li>Link if there's something worthwhile on the other side. Combined with rule #3, this means that I should link to an article, not an encyclopedia.</li>
						</ol>

						<div class=textHeader>On writing a badthink blog</div>
						<p> I don't read blogs&#8212;I tend to think they're boring. By every rule of doing things, this should be a bad one. </p>
						<p>And yet, I've decided to start one. Because I would have no interest reading something in this vein written by another person, I can't pretend it's for you. It's for me. If you want to read it, that's your own business. For me, it's a way to force myself to put things down on paper on a regular basis, and edit them to some quality that precludes the possibility of total embarrassment when they're posted online.</p>
						<p>Consuming information has an opportunity cost, like anything, so you should not be putting words into your body if they represent experiences (unless they're really insightful experiences) or observations (unless they're really insightful observations). Even in the age of the internet, information density is important and granulated thoughts are the best thing to read.</p>
						<p>By that reasoning, there's very little justification for consuming content like this. Wikipedia, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and Project Gutenberg are all just sitting there. Go on.</p>
						<p>I'm still here, typing away at the Badthink blog, because I'm testing out a nugget of wisdom from writer Dan Harmon. Roughly paraphrased, it runs that there is no such thing as writers block, only a belief that you're better than your current ideas. Only by knowingly writing the stuff you'd like to think you're  better than do you get to the stuff you feel like you deserve. </p>
						<p>Writing consists of two parts: thought formulation and thought articulation. Because I'm a selfish person, I'm more interested in the formulation than the articulation, but I could stand to get better at both. And if this post ends up on the web, I've opted for the panopticon because the alternative is picking my nose in my cell.</p>
