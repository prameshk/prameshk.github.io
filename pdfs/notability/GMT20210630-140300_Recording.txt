00:10:19	Nikita Thomas:	This isn’t a question for the professor -  I was just wondering if there’s a groupme or something like that for this class?
00:13:38	Harvey Ng:	Sorry to interrupt, may I know where can I find the lecture notes for this lecture? I don't see it anywhere. Thank you for the help :)
00:13:54	Harvey Ng:	Sure. Thank you very much
00:21:45	Tanveer Bhuiyan:	Following Nikita's post about the group me or any group chat for the class for group study
00:26:15	Vida Tayebati:	Does regular means that we can show it by a DFA?
00:26:23	Vida Tayebati:	thank you
00:30:57	Alison Keenan:	Empty set?
00:30:58	Vida Tayebati:	empty string?
00:31:59	Yinon Shirazi:	what would k be in your examples for A*?
00:32:47	Yinon Shirazi:	thank you!
00:49:57	Tiffany Neumann:	https://groupme.com/join_group/69036395/WWS0XCLA
00:50:11	Andrea Bustamante Ammeter:	Thanks !
01:09:50	Raina Liu:	union
01:18:43	Vida Tayebati:	the accepting state in NFA is always at the end only?
01:19:48	Vida Tayebati:	thanks
01:19:51	Vida Tayebati:	yes thanks
01:30:56	Vida Tayebati:	q1
01:31:18	Tiffany Neumann:	q3
01:32:16	Dimitri Simcox:	empty for e
01:32:33	Dimitri Simcox:	Q4 sorry
01:33:16	Yinon Shirazi:	do we need to specify E U (e)?
01:33:54	Yinon Shirazi:	got it, thanks!
01:35:23	Tiffany Neumann:	I hate to be the person to do this if people want to leave but class ends at 12:40pm I think
01:35:37	Dimitri Simcox:	^
01:35:50	Tiffany Neumann:	haha
01:37:44	Caleb Nieh (he/him):	If you get the chance would you mind scrolling back up to the end of the definition of NFA’s (the r_0 r_i+1 stuff) because I didn’t get to finish copying it down?
01:38:26	Caleb Nieh (he/him):	Thank you!!
01:55:13	Ashwin Padaki:	is it guaranteed that R is in E(R)
02:04:29	Dimitri Simcox:	Is it R in Q’ or R subset Q’?
02:05:08	Dimitri Simcox:	Thank you!
02:07:19	Tiffany Neumann:	{2,3}?
02:08:17	Tiffany Neumann:	Loop?
02:11:17	Tiffany Neumann:	Can you explain again how the e (epsilon) holds its state ( like from 1 to 3)?
02:13:59	Tiffany Neumann:	Thanks!
02:21:56	Mohanad Mohamed:	why would it be 4 live branches at the end? I only count 3
02:22:38	Mohanad Mohamed:	Ah I see
02:25:27	Dimitri Simcox:	Thanks Prof!
02:27:02	Mohanad Mohamed:	Thanks professor
