00:02:34	Sana Ahmed:	I just wanted to clarify: going forward will this class be in person only? or will there be a hybrid option?
00:03:12	Tim Randolph:	Hi Sana - going forward, there will be three options: in-person, Zoom livestream (at the same time as class), and asynchronous video. You can attend any of them
00:03:31	Sana Ahmed:	Okay, Thank you!
00:04:08	Tim Randolph:	Today, we're virtual because of a classroom registration snafu. I've just received confirmation that on Wednesday we'll be in IAB 417 if you're planning to attend in person.
